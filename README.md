A truly subpar language just for UTD!

Grammar:

&emsp;    | λ\
Type := number\
&emsp;     | string\

&emsp;          | λ\

&emsp;          | read ( ID ) :)\
&emsp;          | write ( ID ) :)\
&emsp;          | call ID ( IdList ) :)\

Language Features:\
\
IDs are strictly numerical characters, upper or lower case is fine\
\
Strings start with a " and end with a ", they cannot contain any new lines or tab characters\
To include a " character, it can be escaped with \\", Similarly, \\ can be escaped with \\\\ \
When two strings are added together, it concatenates them.\
\
Numbers are strictly integers, when division occurs, values are truncated\
Numbers may start with a - symbol to denote they are negative.\
\
Flags can either be up or down as a binary value\
If two flags are added, it is an 'or' expression, if they are multiplied it is an 'and' expression.\
The ? symbol represents greater than or equal to. It is the only comparator operation needed.\
\
When statements will execute if the flag is up, if not the body is skipped.\
\
We end all statements with a smiley face :) because we are happy to write code.
